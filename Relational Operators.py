# Relational Operators 
# equal to operator: ==
# not equal to operator: !=

# 2 * 2 == 2 + 2
first_expression = True # this statement is true, as 2*2=4 and 2+2=4 also. Therefore 4 == 4.

# 3 + 3 != 3 * 3
second_expression = True # this statement is true, as 3+3=6 and 3*3=9. Therefore 6 != 9

# 3 * 3 == '9'
third_expression = False # this statement is false as '9' is a string. 3*3=9, nine is a integer and integers are not equal to a string
